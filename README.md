# Too-Many-Things
 Too many things (to remember!) is a Checklist manager, as humans can't reasonably remember every single thing.
 The application is a Windows program, built using **.NET Core**, the **ReactiveUI Framework**, and **WPF** for the user-interface.
 
TMT currently acts as a proof of concept, and it features everything for managing checklists, including adding, removing, editing, and ticking off Checklists + the entries inside. It also features the ability to connect to a Database and storing all of the checklist data on it, in order to have it synchronized between devices. The user only needs to provide a valid SQL login, and the back end will deal with creation and verification of the DB through Entity Framework. ðŸ™‚

- **Connecting to Sql**:
  - You can connect to any online or local server.
  - **'Test Connection'** will ping the server, and the UI will respond accordingly if it was successful.
  - If the ping is successful you can save the connection, and the back-end will automatically configure the database or create one if it doesn't already exist.
  - Once connected to, the App will stay in sync with the database!
